# Statistics-and-Econometrics


This repository contains a collection of lecture notes on statistics and econometrics, covering various statistical and econometric topics. These notes aim to provide insight into both theoretical and applied econometrics, highlighting essential econometric techniques, particularly instrumental variables and related estimation methods.

## Examples of Included Lecture Notes

### Instrumental Variables Part 1
This document provides an introduction to instrumental variables (IV) estimation, primarily focusing on the motivation behind IV methods, such as addressing omitted variable bias. It explains the requirements for a valid instrument, the implications of weak instruments, and the use of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach, with a particular emphasis on the returns to education as an empirical example.

### Instrumental Variables Part 2
Building on the basics from Part 1, this document delves into deeper theoretical aspects of instrumental variables. It covers the conditions necessary for causal identification, demonstrates the Wald estimator, and discusses issues such as weak instruments and asymptotic bias. The document also features applied examples, including the use of birth quarter as an instrument for education.
